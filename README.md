## Upload CSV and Return Table
Uses package CsvHelper for parsing the file.  Angular 11 is used on the frontend, .NET 5 WebApi used for the basic REST API, and Sqlite via EF Core and MongoDB for data persistence. 

Copy the ./Backend/sample.db file to your machine into the c:\data directory for database stuff to work.  Not a fan of how I had to hard code the path the Sqlite file but I didn't want to muck around with the .NET Core config stuff for this demo and didnâ€™t want to tie the DB configuration and usage in the WebApi library.  For a production app that would be a requirement.

To run website, fire up the .NET RestApi project and run the Angular UX via ng serve from the WebUX folder.

## Access Giphy API
The javascript portion of the exercise can be executed by opening the ./giphy.htm file in your local browser.  Like the Angular exercise, this is bare bones "enter text; click button; see image" type of implementation.

## Sudoku
Simple .NET 5 executable that takes in a single command line arg and verifies if the file contains a valid Sudoku solution.  

For example, after building, execute ".\Sudoku.exe C:\file\sudoku.txt".  Simply outputs "File 'C:\file\sudoku.txt' passes Suduko validation." or "File 'C:\file\sudoku.txt' is NOT valid: {reason}".
